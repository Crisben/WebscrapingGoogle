Webscraping Google with R and RSelenium

With this code the objective is to obtain the RUC of some enterprises in Ecuador, we can use the oficial web page SRI in Ecuador to do it, but in some cases we can have different names, or with some small changes, so, the idea is to use google and get some insgihts and then use that result to continue mining and reduce manual work.
